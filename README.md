<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
AlasseaBot is an early attempt to provide an extensible general purpose discord bot that could be managed through commands. It can be extensible in the sense that new commands could be added without the need to modify the bot core.
### Current State
The current features already implemented are:
* Easy way to add new commands: Just extend the provided abstract class, place your command in a specific folder and restart the bot. The command loader will detect the command received from discord (using a prefix, i.e. `,mycmd`) and will try to load a class with that name in the custom folder (i.e. `Commands\Custom\MycmdCommand`). For an easy example checkout the class `Commands\Custom\EchoCommand` or check `Commands\System\QodCommand` for a more complex example.
* Support for passing of parameters from discord to the custom commands (i.e. `,mycmd param1 param2`).
* Support for custom commands with a three-stage loading phase: prepare(), run() and cleanup() to allow for more custom implementation of commands.
* Access to the high level discord-php api.
* A native php and light NoSQL-like database facility available for your custom commands with an out of the box persistent cache. For an example on how to use this, check `Commands\System\QodCommand` that makes use of its own cache context to store the `quote of the day` the first time is requested.
#### Commands list
* `,restart` : Will restart the bot on-the-fly (it will load new code added to it). It is not necesary to restart the bot after adding new commands, it will load them dinamically.
* `,hello` : Basic hello (world?) command.
* `,echo` : Commad that will reply back with the received parameters.
* `,info` : Prints an embed with some info from the bot (i.e. versions).
* `,qod` : Quote of the day command to retrieve qod using the free `quotes.rest` API
#### ToDo
* Restrict commands by a sort-of `admin` role (so only admins could restart the bot for example).
* Add out of the box support for custom auto reaction roles.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* composer: Install composer on your system (if you don't have it already). (Maybe I should add a `composer.phar` to the project

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lpenap/alassea-bot.git
   ```
2. Install composer packages
   ```sh
   composer install
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Run from the cli and from the project folder (This is important since the restart command will work only if you start the bot with this):
```sh
php src/alassea-bot.php 0
```


<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. Contribution can be in the form of a new core functionality or new custom commands that could make its way to become system commands.

The project is currently using Eclipse PHP Convention (built in) and not the Zend or psr-2 convention (this is because this convention is similar to conventions from other language I regularly use. I can be convinced otherwise with a good argument... maybe.)

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
